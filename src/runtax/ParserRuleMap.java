/**
* The ParserRuleMap defines the Rules for parsing a Rule from a String according to the specified Rules.
* Only single line Rule definitions are allowed at the moment.
* <p>Example:
<pre>
{@code
#this is a
# comment
#double quotes are evaluated as text
rule1Name= "text"
#single quotes are evaluated as regex
rule2Name ='regex'
#unnecessary spaces are just ignored â€“ start, end and surrounding the first equals sign
 rule3Name = rule1Name rule2Name
#multiple spaces are counted as one space
  rule4Name  =   rule2Name  rule3Name 
#unknown char sequences are evaluated as text, as long as they don't contain a space or true newline
#evaluated as the text 'text'
rule5Name = text
#evaluated as the separate texts "first" and "second", effectively reassembled as "firstsecond", so without space
rule6Name = first second
#evaluated as the text "first second"
rule7Name = "first second"

#empty lines are ignored

#special characters

#immediately following the target without space
# optional : ?
# zeroOrMore : *
# oneOrMore : +

#might not appear or only once
optional = "This text is optional."?
#might not appear or as often as it wants
zeroOrMore = "a"*
#might appear once or more times
oneOrMore = "b"+
#TODO: gotta figure out how lazy and greedy work out...

#surrounded by spaces
# oneOf : |

#TODO: decide between the following two options
# 1: could be "a" or "b" or "cd"
# 2: could be "ad" or "bd" or "cd"
oneOf = "a" | "b" | "c" "d"

#needs space or special character on the outer side
# grouping : ()

#the regex of a variable is surrounded by parentheses when it is referenced
#equivalent to the regex '((((\Qa\E)*)((\QThis text is optional.\E)?) ((\Qb\E)+))|((\QThis text is optional.\E)?(\QThis text is optional.\E)?)+)?'
group = ((zeroOrMore optional oneOrMore) | (optional optional)+)?

#order matters!
#evaluated as the optional text "doIExist"
tooEarly = doIExist?
#variables only exist in lines below the declaration
doIExist = "Only after this line"
}
</pre>
* <p>Note: Singleton because there's no meaning in having multiple instances of it.
